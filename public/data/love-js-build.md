# LOVE JS BUILD : Porting a LOVE game to the Web!

## Date : 14-08-2025

Okay this was harder than I expected! I was making a game for #jumpstart and found out that they need a browser version to test easilyy ( SMHH I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT THIS BEFOREHAND )

But then I finally used A love web builder : https://schellingb.github.io/LoveWebBuilder, and oh lord, even more Issues rose!
I found out that my current used font wasnt supported and it gave a 'Cursor not supported' error ( Wierdly ). So I had to adjust with a bitmap font :D

AND I FINALLY GOT IT WORKINGG!!!

I am so happy, I used 240 mb memory and 20 stack to make this work, and that was the day I made a web-playable GAME :DD

Play my game here if you want to try it <3
