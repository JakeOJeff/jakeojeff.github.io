# RPG CARDS!

## Date : 12-08-2025

Finally! After months of completing RPG. I got my trading cards. They look VERY Amazing and I love them ( thank you phthallo ). I worked on a 2D Physics Engine for this which turned out pretty cool actually! I even got on the top 5 leaderboards for this which im very very happy about ehhehe.

I also got the SOM stickers again along with this which Im very confused about, but I ain't complaining!
