# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, written using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. Simpler Styles have been been used with a white themed website. 

I have added a bonus page for my friend at '/kyyanite'. Other main pages include the about me page, blogs and project pages. This project was initially made on HTML/CSS before it was migrated.
